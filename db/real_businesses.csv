Growing up he spent endless weekends and summers in Galveston fishing off the surf and piers all around the island. Saltwater fishing and being on or near the sea have always been a passion and a sanctuary for him. After spending some time in the military, including two tours in Afghanistan, Captain Rene was drawn back to his second home for some much needed rest and relaxation. After some deep soul searching, his heart was moved to share his passion and sanctuary with others. He earned his captain's license in 2017 and started his veteran owned business the following year. His motto is ""Inspire Share Respect"". Inspire one another, Share with each another, and Respect everything life has to offer.

534,Crisis Averted RV Examinations ~ CARVE,CARVE,For Profit,Automotive Inspection Services,Recreational Vehicle and Camper Inspections,"With a career in Emergency Medical Services both in the military and civilian sectors, Mike understands the urgency of treating an issue immediately to prevent more problems. After more than two decades helping people in medical crisis, he has transitioned his career goals to help people within the community he thrives in most… those who also embrace the RV and mobile lifestyle.

Mike’s leisure time was comprised mostly of driving in a Jeep as deep offroad as it would take him and he really loves over-landing! After meeting his wife in 2009, she joined the adventures and they hit the road together with their “Jeep pups” Ash and Jinx, travel trailer in tow, to explore North American! As their adventures took them farther north (they married in Leavenworth, WA in 2019) Out in the wilderness, they became interested in the RVs they kept encountering during their travels.

Mike became an NRVIA Inspector to help others, in some way, while growing the community he embraced… exploring in an RV or motorhome. Wanting to be able to fix his own issues as much as possible, he wandered deeper into the details and is now working to also become a Certified RV Technician. When he isn’t completing Inspections, this will allow him to help fellow adventure seekers with small fixes saving them weeks of wait time at their local RV dealership.",811198: All Other Automotive Repair and Maintenance,N/A,SDVOB,7079 Glencoe Harbor Ave,Las Vegas,NV,89179,"Clark County, NV Washington County UT Mohave County AZ Southern NV and Surrounding Areas",(702) 530-3560,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://www.facebook.com/1CARVE,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Jodi,DiGaetano,Co-Owner,"Navy, Retired",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Monday: Closed

Roughly 40% of all homeless veterans are African American or Hispanic, despite only accounting for 10.4% and 3.4% of the U.S. veteran population, respectively. Homeless veterans are younger on average than the total veteran population. Approximately 9% are between the ages of 18 and 30, and 41% are between the ages of 31 and 50. Conversely, only 5% of all veterans are between the ages of 18 and 30, and less than 23% are between 31 and 50. America’s homeless veterans have served in World War II, the Korean War, Cold War, Vietnam War, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon, Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq (OEF/OIF), and the military’s anti-drug cultivation efforts in South America. Nearly half of homeless veterans served during the Vietnam era. Two-thirds served our country for at least three years, and one-third were stationed in a war zone.

I ask for your support and generosity to help bring a better life to Veterans who gave selflessly to defend the freedoms we all enjoy as Americans in the greatest country in the world.","NAICS Code 813410: Civic and Social Organizations
